I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Gonna try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no -
I can't get no -
When I'm driving in my car
And the man comes on the radio
And he's tellin' me more and more
'Bout some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no -
No, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
Gonna I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no -
I can't get no -
When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts should be
But he can't be a man 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no -
No, no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no girl reaction
Gonna I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no -
I can't get no -
